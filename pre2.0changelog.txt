0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Testing some shit out
-Totally not stealing JRJathome's stylish item tracker for now
-Seriously man I do plan on making it my own, I'm just learning off of your code.
-Considering changing the Mushroom+Powder icon, considering you only have one or the other at any point
-groups.json exists in jrjathome's tracker but is never used.  Changed it to represent dungeons, to see what happens
-adjusted max seashells from 22 to 26 for completionist's sake
-added picture tracking for all 2 of you that want to track that, though only 11 pictures can be taken due to Ghostie being removed altogether
-unsure why chest-open.png was outside of the images folder
-map tracking might have been an intention of jrjathome, as evidenced by the manifest.json and locations.json
-yasnoozeyalose.jpg
-removed Manbo on the tracker because it opens zero checks (kept it in the code, however, in case Saver adds other purposes for Manbo)
-considering making the shovel progressive with boomerang, because what other item do you trade with lol
-made Shovel, Feather, Boots, Hookshot, and Magic Rod "progressive", as you could theoretically trade those with boomerang
-added sprites to account for that
-Spoke with JRJathome himself on Discord, chill guy, 10/10
-Added consumable Small Keys to the items.json, future-proofing for keysanity
-Added Nightmare Keys to the items.json, future-proofing for keysanity
-changed mushroom/powder composite toggle to progressive because you're never gonna have both at the same time
-spoke with SporyTike, who said he'd been working on an LADX tracker before but had stopped due to time constraints on his end
-he gave me his project files!  Awesome
-but then he asked if we can work on the tracker together
-politelydeclined.jpg
-After a lot of work I finally have plotted points on the map!
-In the future, definitely going to add more focus on the logic.lua, as right now it's useless
-LADX is pretty simple so maybe I won't need it??
-Shellsanity as a concept scares me
-Adding settings like Hamsda's OoT tracker scares me but I know I can do it
-lots of work to go
-stole the has() function from Hamsda's logic.lua
-Hamsda is a super nice guy, 10/10 would ask for help again
-Typed this from my phone using TeamViewer, sending project files back and forth through Google Drive is no longer an option lol
-Changed max amount of shells from 25 to 22, because JRJathome's reasoning is right, you're never gonna want to get more than 22


0.9 (Pink Build)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-"Simple" Dungeon Tracking
	Shows number of non-dungeon items (keys, compass, map, stone beak)
-"Advanced" Dungeon Tracking
	Shows each check's accessability and name, regardless of how many dungeon items there are

-Considering adding maps for each dungeon
-Considering adding an "items only" tracker, but JRJathome's is pretty nice as is
-Definitely going to make new setting symbols at some point


1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Removing the Advanced Dungeon Tracking so that this can be released in the first place, will add it back later
Will definitely add an Items Only Tracker
Added progressive bombs, arrows, powder capacities


1.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adjusted logic:
	Bombs can be used to access Well HP
	Heart Piece of shame can be collected/grappled to with the hookshot

Added locations:
	The hibiscus trade just didn't exist prior lol

Added settings:
	Added Beta Cave and Start Chest settings.  These only reveal one check each, but they weren't hard to implement (and it's not like Sword Shuffle reveals more than one check anyway).


1.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adjusted Logic:
	Adjusted Paphl and the Path to Paphl to be accessable with hookshot, feather, and flippers with overworld mods on.
	Adjusted Richard's Villa cave chest to be accessable with hookshot
	Adjusted D5 to only be full-clearable with the feather (small key near Round 4)

Added locations:
	Heart Piece in cave after Lanmola - corrupted before, didn't show, fixed


1.0.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adjusted logic:
	Fixed the forest tunnel first chest, now it requires the sword to break the crystals
	Adjusted nearly every dungeon to have the proper number of checks

Adjusted locations:
	Boomerang Moblin now only has one chest.  I know what I want to do with him, but I'm gonna have to figure out how to implement it.  Having 5 hosted items isn't gonna be what's gonna work.


1.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adjusted Locations:  Bumped the location of the western mountain summit, Kanalet's moat, and Marin at Mabe to make them easier to click on their own.
		Fixed the spelling of "Have 20 Shels"

Adjusted logic: Entering D2 access rules had a typo for lift1, was formerly "lidt1"

Added Advanced Dungeon Tracking:
	Use the alternate tabs to see the other dungeons and track the locations of checks in the dungeon!

Adjusted visuals:  Added more detail to the Overworld/Cave Connector modfication settings.  Hopefully they're more clear now.  I can't really think of any good ways to symbolize these changes, so if you have ideas, please let me know, I can be found at MuffinJets#7751 on Discord.


1.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adjusted Logic: 
	Advanced D8's entrance logic was fixed.  Previously, the entrance access rules were written as comments so that I could test them.  If there's one thing I've learned about working with VS Code, it's that Comments Aren't Permitted in JSON.


1.1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adjusted Logic:
	Kanalet Castle - adjusted to need feather with overworld mods off
	Fixed D2 in advanced tracking - Boss' access rules now work properly
	The "Remote Cave" south of D8's entrance can now be accessed without feather if you have access to West Tal Tal.
	Fixed West Horseheads and Raft Minigame check to now need L-2 Bracelets


1.1.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added locations: 
	Added the chest near Round 3 of the Stalfos fight in D5

-Fixed the trigger for Marin at the Beach, now only needs pineapple and shield to access
-Fixed the Kanalet Castle checks to no longer be broken after you have later than the stick in the trading sequence
-Reworked Heart Piece Shuffle setting to look better, the small text really didn't fit well
-Reworked Shellsanity setting to look better, the text didn't look good in comparison
-Reworked Overworld/Cave Connector Mods setting symbols, again.  Hopefully these are clear enough.
-Yesterday, I learned that bomb triggering the egg only is beneficial if you don't have the ocarina, so I fixed the logic there, and made the endgame only one check


1.2.0.0.0.0.0.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Adjusted the number of small keys D7 had


1.2.0.0.0.0.0.0.2

-Added Cave Shuffle, using ideas from windfish.io and Hamsda's Entrance Randomizer variants

1.4.3 - The Pre-Cosmetic Overhaul
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Many of the pictures are less blurry because they have been manually upscaled.  Special thanks to JRJathome for giving me permission to use them

-Items Only variant slightly reworked so that streamers can use it better.  Will do the same to the broadcast layout of the simple dungeon tracking soon.

-Prepared files for a larger update later on that will implement the settings-popup and possibly the capture-item popup like in the Z1 tracker.

-As if on cue, I had to fix the Rooster Key Cave again.  ffs



1.4.8 - The Cosmetic Overhaul
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Merged the "simple" and "advanced" dungeon tracking together, after realiizng that you could use both or them individually with no issue.

-Part of previous change, adjusted how dungeon chests show up in the location dropdown and on the item tracking.

-Rearranged a few of the items on the item grid to remove the redundancy of tracking the Evil Orb and the red/blue mail.  Replaced the spot with Piece of Heart tracking.

-Removed the "Items with Keys" variant because it wasn't used and the item/key grid got reworked anyway.  Keysanity will most likely never come to LADXR, but if it ever does, I will re-implement upon request.

-With the help of Dudude Dude on Discord, I added the ability to add badges to captureable checks.  While somewhat useful in the Standard variant, this will be a godsend for Cave Shuffle, and puts it on-par with windfish.io imho.

-Adjusted the name of many of the Cave Shuffle checks to align with the aforementioned capture badges, but also notably the Mysterious Woods Eastern Cave, as it was actually the Western Cave the entire time.  I'm an Eagle Scout, I should know this shit lol

-I can't set the Pin Locations on Item Capture to disabled by default, go let EmoSaru know if that's a feature that you want.  Tell her specifically that you want pack creators to be able to change that setting, because we currently can't.

-As per previous change, added the "Cool Thx" item as it's shown in the Cave Shuffle variant on bootup.

-Completely reworked the Settings menu.  Gone are the days of not knowing what each setting does.

-Removed Wall-rus check when restructuring settings

-Added the logical requirements of Wall-rus to the Desert checks, they are bound to break, I'm sure

-Removed Sword Shuffle setting, edited the Sword on the Beach check to match this

-Added a gray sprite for the Mad Batter capacity upgrades

-Cleaned up the file names for future reference

-THE NEXT UPDATE WILL BE THE AUTOTRACKING ONE. AUTOTRACKING IS DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT FOR THIS GAME BUT IT WILL HAPPEN EVENTUALLY


1.4.10 Cosmetic Overhaul Hotfix
--------------------------------------
-Adjusted Items Only variant to mirror Broadcast View

1.5.0 The Not AutoTracking update
---------------------------------------
-EmoTracker apparently doesn't like it when you have a number as big as 1.4.10, so we're going to 1.5 already.  

1.5.1 Still not the Autotracking Update
----------------------------------------
-Adjusted vertical Cave Shuffle Variant to have the correct D7 instrument

1.5.2 The Cosmetic Update where Autotracking Should Be
----------------------------------------
-Added optional Key Logic tracking, because having to click on every key is tedious, but possibly required for less familiar players

-Removed the "simple" dungeon tracking from the non cave shuffle variant as it was redundant to click back and forth

-Completely redrawn the settings images to make them look better

-Changed the tracker layout because it was really ugly before

-Changed the broadcast layout to match the changes made to the item grid

-Since you get the shield so early, I made it impossible to disable the shield on the tracker

-Adjusted checks in late D4 so that key logic works correctly

-Adjusted D5 boss to require boss key

-Fixed D8's Blaino to require a method of attacking him.  It was in the code, but it had a typo.

-Fixed Ballad check to require the Sword when not expecting the Walrus

-Fixed D4's Lonely Chests, now requires feather and two keys to access, with optional flippers (for Jesus Jumping)

-Filled the empty slot with the tunic color

-Adjusted D3's simple tracking to now require the feather in order to full-clear

-Adjusted the location of the Ledge Chest's entrance in D4 to its proper location

-Adjusted D5's logic to no longer require the first small key, since the locked door isn't there in the randomizer

-In D6, adjusted the Blade Trap Ledge and East Horseheads to now require feather.  The latter required feather before, but didn't due to a typo.

-After long last, I finally added that one chest in D2 that I kept forgetting!  \o/

-Reorganized some of the image files for better organization

-Pushed the Rapids 1 check to the right a little bit so it actually looked like it was on the island

1.5.3  The Fabled Hotfix
---------------------------------------------
-Removed vertical layout because it was stupid to set up

-Learning Ballad should now require owning at least one instrument.  That isn't the requirement, but Marin is finnicky and this is the best way of tracking it.

-Made sure that the Graveyard Connector Cave requires hookshot.  Made it out of logic if you have only feather.

1.5.4  Like, really close, I swear
--------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------
-Fixed "$kill_wiz" typo in D6's East Horseheads

-Adjusted shell requirements for upcoming Shellsanity setting in 0.50

-Added fire rod to Evil Orb's death requirements

-Adjusted position of various check locations

-Removed redunancy in "Cross-Shape North of Key Cavern" check and "East of Seashell Mansion" check

-Renamed Cave Shuffle Variant

-Cave Shuffle variant's item grid was literally 10 pixels seperated from the side of the screen. Literally unuseable until this update.

-Cave Shuffle variant layout - centered Key row since I moved the tunic further down

-Added a setting to the Cave Shuffle variant to show or hide redunant caves


1.5.6  I'm gonna have to stop naming these updates
-----------------------------------
-Reduced the Town Tool Shop down to it's first item, as that is what will be randomized and bombs can be found later on.


1.5.7
-----------------------------------
-Added Ocarina as a requirement to Frog's Song check

-Fixed Remote Cave to align with new West Tal logic function

-Fixed D4's entrance requirement to no longer require Flippers

	-Fishing Minigame pre-sword, if the start chest is rupees
	-Town Tool Shop, if the start chest is 200 rupees
	-Underneath Richard's Villa via Villa Skip

1.5.8
-----------------------------------------------
-Gave the powder, bombs, and bow the ability to be right-clicked to individually show Mad Batter upgrades, since they can be obtained without the base item

-Gave the Feather, Boots, Shovel, Hookshot, and Rod boomerang icons, similiar to the Mad Batter icons above.

-Adjusted many cave shuffle images, made the letters a higher resolution and added a color to the dungeons to make them stand out more

-Added new cave shuffle capture images for more specific circumstances.

-Added pictures of the bosses to the instruments in item grids for all layouts.  No logic, yet.

-Added the "Number of Instruments" setting to the Cave Shuffle variant

-Added a hosted powder to D0, as it's a logical source of powder

-Added hosted bombs to Kanalet Castle and split the two interior areas to better suit this change

1.7.3
-------------------------------

LADXR: 
	- Fixed mountain range now not inheriently requiring boots in Glitched Logic
	- Fixed D2 hard-requiring feather for it's checks when you have bracelet and/or hookshot
	- D2's Owl Statues didn't have key logic for some reason, now they do
	- Cleaned up D6 and D8 Owl Statue requirements, they were repetitive, redundant and messy
	- Introduced optional alternately colored maps
	- Dungeon Shuffle:
		When enabled, the overworld representations of the dungeons will dissappear. The logic for each dungeon 
		in their respective map tabs will ignore the front door's logic.
Z4R:
	-Added Dungeon Shuffle, see above

Z4R Caves:
	- EmoTracker's core standardized image sizes for capture badges, cleaned up a few images to match this

 LADXR:
 - Condensed "Number of Instruments Required" setting into "Egg Goal"
 - Added 20 Shells as an alternate Egg Goal

 - Adjusted Boo Buddies room in D2 to logically require 5 small keys but be accessible with 2
 - Added Open Egg Goal, had forgotten to add it before

 - Reworked dungeon key item grid, should now be easier to edit from now on

- Kanalet Castle Bird check now can be accessed with powder to break the bush
