Hey!

Thanks for checking out the backend of my map tracker.  

Whether you're here to take the image files or if you're here to learn how to create your own map tracker, you're welcome to take anything you want.

If you are a pack creator, feel free to message me on Discord, in the rando server, or in DMs.  The EmoTracker Discord server can be a little intimidating if you don't know what you're doing, so it's completely reasonable to not want to ask for help there.

If you're using the Export Overrides tool to customize this pack to how you want, that's awesome!  I'd love to know what you've changed so I can possibly implement it into the next update, I'm always open to suggestions.


No matter why you're seeing this message, I'm glad you're here and I hope you have a good time playing the LADX randomizers.

Thank you,
MuffinJets


HOW TO USE AUTOTRACKING:
---------------------------

1. Make sure you're using a compatible version of Bizhawk. EmoTracker shares ConnectorLib with Crowd Control, so if you see a message 
    talking about Crowd Control, you can't use that build of Bizhawk. At the time of writing this the latest confirmed compatible
    version is 2.4.2.
2. Open Bizhawk and the randomized ROM file.
3. Open Tools -> Lua Console
4. In the Lua Console, go to File -> Open Session (or click the folder icon)
5. Navigate to where EmoTracker is installed (by default, this should be C:\Program Files\EmoTracker)
6. In that folder, open connectors -> bizhawk -> connector.lua
7. In EmoTracker, right-click the little robot icon in the bottom-right, then click Gameboy -> Lua

If everything went right, the robot icon should turn a light-blue color and your autotracking should be working!

If the robot turns red, you may need to update EmoTracker, my map package, or your version of Bizhawk.
If the emulator is paused for whatever reason, the robot may turn yellow as it attempts to reconnect.
If you have any issues, message either myself or wolfman2000#6187 on Discord
